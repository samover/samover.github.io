`coding * navy_seals = makers_academy`
-------------------------------------
A month ago I started the precourse for [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com) in order to learn how to code in 12 weeks. 4 weeks of preparation learning command line, github and ruby in order to be sufficiently prepped for what some have dubbed *'coding meets the Navy Seals'*. There is only one word for what I am going through: AWESOME! Here is a great introduction to the course.
