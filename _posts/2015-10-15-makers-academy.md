A month ago I started the precourse for [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com) in order to learn how to code in 12 weeks. 4 weeks of preparation learning command line, github and ruby in order to be sufficiently prepped for what some have dubbed *'coding meets the Navy Seals'*. It feels like an impossible task.

I don't know what I will be at the end of this journey. What I do know is that I will have learned a tremendous amount. The experience so far has been nothing less than AWESOME! Whatever else these weeks will throw at me, I think I'm ready!

Here is a great introduction to the course.
