After having studied and worked for many years in teaching and social work, I now pursue another of my passions: coding. This blog traces the process of me being geekified by Makers Academy. I am not quite sure yet what form the blog will take. I presume - knowing myself - that it will be a mixture of reflective musings and more technical posts.
